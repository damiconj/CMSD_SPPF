	   Purpose:	Query that calcualtes the percentage of students proficient or higher by subject and year for all 
	   students in a school, based on common core state testing data (PARCC, AIR). Student totals for the denominator
	   are based on students in testing table and potentially miss untested students that have no records there.
	   PROF_LEVEL_STATE_AUDIT has official state data that can be used to calculate total percentage proficient 
	   or higher.
