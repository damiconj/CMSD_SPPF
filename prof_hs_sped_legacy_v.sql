	   Purpose:	Query that calcualtes the Proficiency percentages by subject and year for Special Education (SPED)
	   students in a school, based on legacy state testing data (OAA, OGT). Student totals for the denominator are 
	   based on total number of tests and would miss untested students that should be in the denominator.
