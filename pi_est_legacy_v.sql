	   Name:		pi_est_legacy_v
	   Author:	Damico, Nicholas J
	   Purpose:	Query that estimates the Performance Index Points for a school, based on linkage between NWEA
	   data and the legacy state tests (OAA, OGT). PI estimates include READING AND MATH ONLY. Actual PI 
	   calculations will include additional subjects. Estimates assume NWEA testing sample is representative of 
	   End of Year testing population.
